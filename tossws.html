    from time to time, at our discretion. We will make sure to announce any
    major change in a prominent way.

    3. Accessing the App,Security and Privacy

<p dir="ltr">
    We are working hard on improving App, but we can't guarantee that the
    online services will be up and running 24/7. We also reserve the right to
    suspend or restrict access to some features to users. In any case, we will
    not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the App is unavailable
    at any time or for any period, nor for any data loss (see also section 7
    below).
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    To access certain features of the App you have to register by entering your
    email and choosing a password as part of our security procedures. You must
    treat such information as confidential, not disclosing it to any third
    party and only using SWS in person. There is a password reset procedure in
    case you forget your password, but please notify us of any breach of
    security. We highly recommend to choose a strong password (e.g.
    "ilikepizZasoMUCH11!1") and that you log out from your account at the end
    of every session.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    It is a condition of your use of the App that all the information you
    provide on the App is correct, current and complete. In the future, you may
    be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. As
    custom for internet websites, we reserve the right to disable any user
    account, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason,
    including, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any provision
    of these Terms of Service.

    third party. In the unlikely event we receive a disclosure request from an
    authorized party, we reserve the right to disclose user identities when
    required to do so by the law, including in response to a law enforcement
    request supported by a valid court order. You waive and hold harmless the
    Company from any claims resulting from any action taken by the Company
    during or as a result of its investigations and from any actions taken as a
